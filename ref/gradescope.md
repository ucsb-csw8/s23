### Step 0. Go to the website

Open your browser and go to <https://www.gradescope.com>

![Gradescope website](https://ucsb-csw8.github.io/s23/assets/images/gradescope/s0_gradescope-site.png)

### Step 1. Log in to your account

Log in to your gradescope account using your ucsb umail (your_ucsb_netid@umail.ucsb.edu).

![login using email](https://ucsb-csw8.github.io/s23/assets/images/gradescope/s1_login_email.png)

OR choose "log in with school credentials" and use your ucsb netid to log in.

### Step 2. Choose the course

After logging in, you should able to see one course or a list of courses. Choose the **CSW8** course.

### Step 3. Choose the assignment to submit

You should see Gradescope labs that you were assigned there. You may click on one of them and submit your work for that particular lab.

![assignments](https://ucsb-csw8.github.io/s23/assets/images/gradescope/s3_assignments.png)


### Step 4. Submit your assignment

When click and open one of the labs, if you haven't submitted anything for an assignment yet, Gradescope will prompt you (with a box and submit button) to upload your files. You can either click inside the box and navigate to your file(s) or "drag-and-drop" them into the "Submit Programming Assignment" window.

![submit](https://ucsb-csw8.github.io/s23/assets/images/gradescope/s4_submit.png)

### Step 5. Upload multiple files at once

To select multiple files together:
* Mac: hold down `command` key while clicking on the files you would like to add
* Windows: hold down `ctrl` key while clicking on the files you would like to add

### Step 6. Resubmit (if needed)

If you already submitted something on Gradescope, it will take you to their "Autograder Results" page. For most labs, if everything is correct, you'll see a successful submission passing all of the autograder tests.

![successful_submit](https://ucsb-csw8.github.io/s23/assets/images/gradescope/s6_sucessful_submit.png)

There is a **"Resubmit" button** on the bottom right that will allow you to update the files for your submission. You have an unlimited number of submissions up until the lab deadline - we will use the grade of the LAST submitted solution you put in! We recommend submitting your assignment early to make sure that you pass all tests.

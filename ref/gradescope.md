### Step 3. Choose the assignment to submit

You should see Gradescope labs that you were assigned there. You will click on the one submit your work for that particular lab.

### Step 4. Submit: upload your code

When click and open one of the labs, if you haven't submitted anything for an assignment yet, Gradescope will prompt you (with a box and submit button) to upload your files. You either can either click inside the box and navigate to your file(s) or "drag-and-drop" them into the "Submit Programming Assignment" window.

### Step 5. Resubmit (if needed)

If you already submitted something on Gradescope, it will take you to their "Autograder Results" page. For most labs, if everything is correct, you'll see a successful submission passing all of the autograder tests.


There is a **"Resubmit" button** on the bottom right that will allow you to update the files for your submission. You have an unlimited number of submissions up until the lab deadline - we will use the grade of the LAST submitted solution you put in! We recommend submitting your assignment early to make sure that you pass all tests.
